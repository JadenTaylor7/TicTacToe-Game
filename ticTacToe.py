#Milestone project
#Based on my understanding of Python so far, create an interactive tic tac toe game
#Display, accept, validate, update

#Ideas for setup:
#Step 1: create player validate function (validates whether or not X or O)
#Step 2: create display function (shows the board)
#Step 3: create a user choice function (Let's the user choose what to do)
#Step 4: create a menu function (shows what the user can choose, including exit the game)
#Step 5: create a board updater (handles the game logic, sends input to display)
#Step 6: create a winner function (congratulates player if a player has won)
#Step 7: create play again function (clears board and starts over)
#Step 8: fix bugs, full game test cases.
#Idea: user choice will handle all the calls and functions inside it
#Thought: user choice function will have to be called at the very end, because it calls other functions
#That must be previously defined

#Step 1 enacted: Let player 1 decide if X or O. Choose player 2's letter based on player 1 answer.
